* Program to calculate and write a report

* IDEA implementation: [/]
1. Semigroup type class: checks to see if the Lesson type is the same and if it is, the time and the tests values will be combined
2. use the functor type class to implement a Maybe Topic, return Nothing in Case
   of not being equal and return Just Topic in case of two Lessons being equal


* IDEA features: [0/5]
+ [ ] use the Maybe contex to do safer computations
+ [ ] write the output into stdin and file
+ [ ] use the day data to show everyday in a beautiful way
+ [ ] use regex for pattern matching the days
+ [ ] Sorting them before returning them


* TODO features: [9/10]
+ [X] get rid of the prenthesis in "(n,m)"
+ [X] convert a string of "(n,m)" into a tuple of (n,m)
+ [X] make Topic an instance of Semigroup
+ [X] implement the combineTopics function
+ [X] make Topic an instance of Monoid
+ [X] wrap stListToSt and topicsInDays into one function
+ [X] make topic an instance of Show type class
+ [X] a function to clean the output of combineTopics' function
+ [X] make a function to sort the Topics by their name and then sum them together
+ [ ] Make the Topic data type an instance of the Functor type class


* TODO cleaning: [5/5]
+ [X] change the lesson type synonym into the Books data type
+ [X] change the lesson function
+ [X] change the get_ functions
+ [X] change the topicAndQuant function
+ [X] change the allQuant function
